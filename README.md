# BSAT
## Blackbaud Student Account Terminal

This project is a Blackbaud Student tool to let you interact with Blackbaud with Selenium with CLI interfaces, a Discord bot, and website. If your school or institution uses Blackbaud, this is a must-fork!

# How it works!

- We use Selenium to open up your school's portal page.
- We input your username + password for you
- We login to Microsoft and/or Google to allow SSO to be automated
- We scrape information from your home page
- We archive and store all of that information locally
- You interact with the data via CLI, Discord, or a website (all self hosted!)

# Security

- We don't store any information (logins, cookies, etc)
- Self hosted and you manage everything
